Zenercards+ v0.2, by Takis Tsiberis

Zener cards are used to conduct experiments for extra-sensory
perception (ESP). Karl Zener designed the cards in the early
1930s for experiments conducted with his colleague, para-
psychologist J. B. Rhine (source: Wikipedia).

The zener deck consists of five figures: a square, a Greek
cross, a circle, a five-pointed star and three vertical wavy
lines. In this game however, I added five more figures: a
hexagon, a quadrifolium, an archimedian spiral, a rhombus
and the Mandelbrot fractal, hence the Zenercards+ (plus)
title. These additional cards are for the sake of the game,
so to make it more interesting.
